# botwan

The original [@bot__wan](http://twitter.com/bot__wan) code.  

A neural net trained by [@BoozyBrain](http://twitter.com/boozybrain) and [@nickwan](http://twitter.com/nickwan) on [@nickwan](http://twitter.com/nickwan)'s tweets from about June 2017 - December 2017.  

# Dependencies 
This was processed in an Anaconda3 environment (v5.0.1). If you install the full environement, you'll have most of the dependencies used. The only additional dependencies would be:  


keras (tensorflow backend)  
tweepy  
nltk  

# These two current notebooks  
This only loads the previously trained model. This does not train a new model. Once I have that notebook cleaned up, I'll push it here. Until then, feel free to mess around with this in its current form.
